## ❄️Project Overview❄️  

| # | Project | Description | Key Methods / Tech | Outcome |
|---|---------|-------------|---------------------|---------|
| 1 | **Laptop Shop Assistant (Flask App)** | Chatbot that recommends laptops based on user preferences. | NLP, OpenAI API, Flask, Recommendation System | Interactive shopping assistant deployed with Flask. |
| 2 | **Capstone: Eye for Blind** | Generates image captions and converts them to speech for visually impaired users. | CNN + LSTM with Attention, TTS, Flickr8K dataset | AI system that makes images accessible via audio descriptions. |
| 3 | **Decision Trees – Alzheimer’s Disease Analysis** | Predict Alzheimer’s disease based on demographic, medical, and clinical data. | Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, XGBoost, CatBoost | Early detection model for better treatment planning. |
| 4 | **Random Forest – Heart Disease Prediction** | Predicts the presence of heart disease using clinical and demographic data. | Random Forest Classifier | Supports doctors in risk assessment and early intervention. |
| 5 | **Syntactic Processing – Healthcare** | Extract disease–treatment pairs from clinical text. | Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), POS tagging, Contextual features | Structured knowledge extraction from unstructured medical text. |
| 6 | **Automatic Ticket Classification** | Classifies financial complaints into predefined categories. | Topic Modeling (NMF), Logistic Regression | Best model (LogReg) achieved **95% accuracy**, automating complaint triaging. |
| 7a | **Spam Detector (Lexical Processing)** | Classify SMS as spam or ham. Dataset: 5,574 messages. | NLP preprocessing, TF-IDF, Naive Bayes | Achieved **97% accuracy** in spam detection. |
| 7b | **Spell Corrector (Lexical Processing)** | Implements a spelling correction system using edit distance. | Peter Norvig’s algorithm, Probability-based correction | Suggests most probable corrections (e.g., *monney → money*). |
| 8 | **LangChain LLM Applications** | Hands-on implementation of LangChain components to build LLM-powered workflows including prompts, chains, embeddings, and structured outputs. | LangChain, LLMs, Prompt Engineering, Embeddings, Output Parsers, Chains | Built modular LLM pipelines demonstrating real-world GenAI application design. |
| 9 | **Vision Transformers – Architecture Learning & Demos** | Explored Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture through notebooks and code, covering fundamentals like patch embedding, attention mechanisms, and PyTorch implementation. | Vision Transformers (ViT), PyTorch, Attention, Image Representation | Demonstrated understanding of transformer-based vision models and applied architectural concepts in demonstrations. |
