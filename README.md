# üìÇ Machine Learning & AI Projects Portfolio
> Hi üëã, this repository highlights the major ML, NLP, and AI projects I have worked on. Each project demonstrates hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment.

## üìä Project Overview
#	Project	Description	Key Methods / Tech	Outcome
1	Decision Trees ‚Äì Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Analysis	Predict Alzheimer‚Äôs disease based on demographic, medical, and clinical data.	Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, XGBoost, CatBoost	Early detection model for better treatment planning.
2	Random Forest ‚Äì Heart Disease Prediction	Predicts the presence of heart disease using clinical and demographic data.	Random Forest Classifier	Supports doctors in risk assessment and early intervention.
3a	Spam Detector (Lexical Processing)	Classify SMS as spam or ham. Dataset: 5,574 messages.	NLP preprocessing, TF-IDF, Naive Bayes	Achieved 97% accuracy in spam detection.
3b	Spell Corrector (Lexical Processing)	Implements a spelling correction system using edit distance.	Peter Norvig‚Äôs algorithm, Probability-based correction	Suggests most probable corrections (e.g., monney ‚Üí money).
4	Syntactic Processing ‚Äì Healthcare	Extract disease‚Äìtreatment pairs from clinical text.	Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), POS tagging, Contextual features	Structured knowledge extraction from unstructured medical text.
5	Laptop Shop Assistant (Flask App)	Chatbot that recommends laptops based on user preferences.	NLP, OpenAI API, Flask, Recommendation System	Interactive shopping assistant deployed with Flask.
6	Capstone: Eye for Blind	Generates image captions and converts them to speech for visually impaired users.	CNN + LSTM with Attention, TTS, Flickr8K dataset	AI system that makes images accessible via audio descriptions.
7	Automatic Ticket Classification	Classifies financial complaints into predefined categories.	Topic Modeling (NMF), Logistic Regression	Best model (LogReg) achieved 95% accuracy, automating complaint triaging.
